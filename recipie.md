>For preparing the Rajma_Chawal you have to follow the following _steps 

#### Instructions To Prepare:

  +  Soak the rajma **(kidney beans)** for at least 8 hours or overnight. Pressure cook for 5-6 whistles until soft yet not mushy. *Set aside*.

  +   Heat oil and add the cumin seeds. When they sizzle and begin to change colour, add the onions. When they turn pink, add the powdered cinnamon, ginger, and green chillies. *Fry for 2-3 mins*.

  +  Then add the coriander powder, amchur or tamarind, and turmeric. Mix well and cook for another 3-4 mins. My onion-masala mixture is red because **I used red chilli powder instead of green chillies**.
 
  +   Add the cooked rajma along with the water used to cook it in and the sliced tomato. **Mix well and let simmer for 5 mins**.
 
  +   When the gravy thickens a bit, add the chaat masala and salt. **Mix well**, *bring to boil again and turn off heat*.

  +   Add cooked rice and mix gently.

  +    Garnish with chopped coriander leaves **(cilantro)** and ***serve warm with some plain yogurt***.
